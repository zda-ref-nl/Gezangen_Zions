	"preface": "Nearly everyone loves music! What a privilege it is to join together in sweet fellowship and unite our voices in song to honor the God of Heaven. When assembling at youth gatherings, camp meetings and other special events, a handy book such as There Rings a Melody is a great asset. This beautiful little book includes essential excerpts from the Reformation Hymnal, along with additional favorites from other sources.\n\t\\n\\n\n\t“The melody of praise is the atmosphere of heaven; and when heaven comes in touch with the earth, there is music and song—‘thanksgiving, and the voice of melody’ (Isaiah 51:3).”—Education, p. 161. In a corrupt world bombarded with overly rhythmic and sensual music, how refreshing it is to enjoy the lovely contrast provided by the simple, innocent, melodious tunes which characterize true Christian worship.\n\t\\n\\n\n\tThe apostle urges, “Be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord” (Ephesians 5:18, 19). That There Rings a Melody will supply good, wholesome musical options in holy convocations everywhere, is the earnest prayer of\n\t\\n\\n\n\tThe Publishers",
